**Priority**: High | **Duration**: 2-3 weeks | **Type**: Process  
Establish guidelines and guardrails for using Claude Code and other AI tools in SUEWS development, ensuring code quality and scientific accuracy.

### 3. [Open Governance Structure](./open-governance-structure.md)
**Priority**: High | **Duration**: 3-4 weeks | **Type**: Governance  
Create formal governance structure with steering committee, decision-making processes, and community representation.

**Priority**: Medium | **Duration**: 2-3 weeks | **Type**: Technical  
Streamline developer experience with one-command setup, enhanced CI/CD, debugging tools, and comprehensive developer documentation.

### 7. [Dependency Simplification](./dependency-simplification.md)
**Priority**: High | **Duration**: 2-3 weeks | **Type**: Technical  
Reduce core dependencies from 20+ to 5 essential packages, organizing optional features into clear installation groups for lighter, faster installations.

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
- Start API Modernization (technical foundation)
- Establish AI Development Standards (process foundation)
- Draft Governance Structure (organizational foundation)
- Begin Dependency Simplification (reduce installation friction)

### Phase 2: Enhancement (Weeks 5-8)
- Complete API migration tools
- Launch Documentation Overhaul
- Finalize and implement Governance
- Complete dependency reorganization

### Phase 3: Community (Weeks 9-12)
- Launch Community Engagement programs
- Enhance Developer Workflows
- Iterate based on feedback
