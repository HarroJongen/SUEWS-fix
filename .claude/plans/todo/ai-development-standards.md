# Plan: AI-Assisted Development Standards

**Status**: TODO  
**Scope**: Establish Claude Code usage guidelines and guardrails  
**Languages**: Markdown (policies), Python (validation tools)  
**Duration**: 2-3 weeks  
**Priority**: High  

## Background
As the SUEWS development team increasingly adopts Claude Code for development, we need clear standards and guardrails to ensure code quality, security, and maintainability while leveraging AI assistance effectively.

## Objectives
- Create coding standards for AI-assisted development
- Establish review processes for AI-generated code
- Build validation tools to catch common AI mistakes
- Document best practices for team members
- Ensure scientific accuracy in AI-assisted modifications

## Key Deliverables

### 1. Claude Code Guidelines (`.claude/AI_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`)
- **When to Use AI Assistance**
  - Appropriate use cases (boilerplate, refactoring, documentation)
  - Inappropriate use cases (core physics algorithms without review)
  - Guidelines for prompt engineering
  
- **Code Review Requirements**
  - Mandatory human review for physics-related changes
  - Peer review checklist for AI-generated code
  - Documentation requirements
  
- **Testing Requirements**
  - All AI-generated code must have tests
  - Physics validation for model changes
  - Regression testing requirements

- **Common Pitfalls**
  - Over-reliance on AI for domain-specific logic
  - Insufficient validation of generated code
  - Missing edge cases in AI suggestions

### 2. Validation Tools
- **Pre-commit Hooks**
  - Check for common AI-generated patterns
  - Enforce documentation standards
  - Validate physics constraints
  
- **Automated Checks**
  - Code complexity metrics
  - Test coverage requirements
  - Performance regression detection
  
- **CI/CD Integration**
  - Automated testing of AI-generated code
  - Physics validation suite
  - Code quality gates

### 3. Team Training Materials
- **Quick Reference Guide**
  - Do's and don'ts checklist
  - Common commands and workflows
  - Troubleshooting tips
  
- **Example Workflows**
  - Bug fixing with AI assistance
  - Feature development workflow
  - Documentation generation
  
- **Best Practices**
  - Prompt engineering for SUEWS context
  - Iterative development with AI
  - Knowledge preservation strategies

## Implementation Steps

### Week 1: Draft Guidelines and Gather Feedback
- [ ] Create initial AI development guide
- [ ] Survey team for current practices
- [ ] Identify common issues and concerns
- [ ] Draft validation requirements

### Week 2: Implement Validation Tools
- [ ] Set up pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Create custom validation scripts
- [ ] Integrate with CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Test with example scenarios

### Week 3: Training and Rollout
- [ ] Create training materials
- [ ] Conduct team workshop
- [ ] Gather feedback and iterate
- [ ] Finalize documentation

## Technical Considerations
- Balance between enabling productivity and ensuring quality
- Respect for scientific accuracy and domain expertise
- Integration with existing development workflows
- Scalability as team grows

## Success Metrics
- Reduction in AI-related code issues
- Increased development velocity
- Team satisfaction with guidelines
- Maintenance of code quality metrics
- No physics-related errors from AI code

## Dependencies
- Team buy-in and participation
- Access to Claude Code for all developers
- Existing test infrastructure
- CI/CD pipeline access

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk**: Over-restrictive guidelines reducing productivity
  - **Mitigation**: Iterative refinement based on feedback
- **Risk**: AI-generated physics errors
  - **Mitigation**: Mandatory physics validation suite
- **Risk**: Knowledge silos with AI usage
  - **Mitigation**: Documentation requirements, knowledge sharing

## Special Considerations for SUEWS
- Urban climate physics must be preserved accurately
- Fortran/Python interface complexities
- Performance-critical sections need careful review
- Scientific reproducibility requirements

## Open Questions
- [ ] Should we limit AI usage for certain modules?
- [ ] How to track AI-generated vs human-written code?
- [ ] Integration with journal publication requirements?
- [ ] Training budget for team members?
