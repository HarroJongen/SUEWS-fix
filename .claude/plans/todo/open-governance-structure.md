## Success Metrics
- Clear decision trails
- Increased contributor diversity
- Faster issue resolution
- Community satisfaction
- Sustainable development pace

## Dependencies
- Core team agreement
- Community engagement
- GitHub repository admin access
- Communication platforms

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk**: Bureaucracy slowing development
  - **Mitigation**: Lightweight processes, regular reviews
- **Risk**: Lack of participation
  - **Mitigation**: Incentives, recognition, clear benefits
- **Risk**: Power concentration
  - **Mitigation**: Term limits, diverse representation

## Special Considerations for SUEWS
- Academic vs. operational users balance
- International collaboration needs
- Scientific integrity requirements
- Funding acknowledgment policies

## Governance Models to Consider
- Benevolent Dictator (Python)
- Steering Council (Node.js)
- Foundation-based (Apache)
- Federated (Kubernetes)

## Open Questions
- [ ] Legal entity needed?
- [ ] Funding model for sustainability?
- [ ] Trademark considerations?
- [ ] CLA (Contributor License Agreement) needed?
- [ ] How to handle institutional contributors?
