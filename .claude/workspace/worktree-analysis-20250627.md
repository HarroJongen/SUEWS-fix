## Recommendations for Agent Launch

### Priority Order for Agents:
1. **Agent 1**: Work on `core-runtime-fixes` (critical bugs)
2. **Agent 2**: Work on `adjust-default-values` (breaking changes for v2025)
3. **Agent 3**: Continue `hide-internal-options` (already in progress)
4. **Agent 4**: Work on `rsl-physics-fixes` (physics issues)
5. **Agent 5**: Work on `supy-data-processing` (data handling)

### Pre-launch Checklist:
- [ ] Commit changes in hide-internal-options worktree
- [ ] Pull latest master in all worktrees
- [ ] Ensure all agents read their respective plans
- [ ] Set up monitoring for agent progress

### Agent Instructions Template:
```
1. Navigate to worktrees/{worktree-name}
2. Read ../../.claude-plans/feature-{branch-name}.md
3. Check current branch with `git branch --show-current`
4. Review associated GitHub issues
5. Update plan progress as tasks are completed
6. Commit plan updates to master branch
```

## Notes
- All worktrees are properly nested and accessible
- Plans are comprehensive with clear GitHub issue mappings
- No blocking issues preventing agent work
- Consider running tests after agent work before merging
