# SUEWS Conversion Progress Report
## Date: 2025-08-07

## Summary
Successfully fixed critical issues in the SUEWS table conversion system that prevented conversion from 2016a format to 2025a (YAML) format.

## Problems Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Temp Directory Alternation Bug** ✅
**Problem**: The conversion process uses two temporary directories (temp1/temp2) to alternate between conversion steps. The logic was broken - files were copied to `tempDir_1` but the first conversion tried to read from `tempDir_2`.

**Solution**: 
- Fixed the alternation logic by tracking steps completed
- Correctly determine source/destination directories based on step count
- Ensure final step reads from the correct temp directory

**Code Changes**: `src/supy/util/_converter.py` lines 839-930

### 2. **ESTM File Creation with Wrong Format** ✅
**Problem**: SUEWS_ESTMCoefficients.txt was being created with all 52 columns for 2016a format, but conversion rules expected a minimal file with just the Code column, causing "cannot insert column, already exists" errors.

**Solution**:
- Changed placeholder creation to minimal structure (just Code column)
- Let conversion rules progressively add columns
- Same fix applied to BiogenCO2 file

**Code Changes**: `src/supy/util/_converter.py` lines 690-700

### 3. **Missing GridLayoutKc.nml for 2024a+** ✅
**Problem**: GridLayoutKc.nml is required for 2024a+ formats but doesn't exist in earlier versions, causing file not found errors.

**Solution**:
- Added automatic creation of GridLayoutKc.nml when converting to 2024a or 2025a
- Also ensure SUEWS_SPARTACUS.nml is created
- Both files created with sensible default values

**Code Changes**: `src/supy/util/_converter.py` lines 562-634

### 4. **Debug Mode Implementation** ✅
**Feature Added**: The `-d debug_dir` option now works correctly
- Preserves all intermediate conversion steps
- Each step saved in separate directory
- Helps troubleshoot multi-step conversions

## Current Status

### Working ✅
```bash
# Table-to-table conversion (2016a to 2024a)
suews-convert -i test/fixtures/legacy_format/2016a -f 2016a -o test_conv-x -t 2024a -d debug_conversion

# Direct YAML conversion from 2024a
suews-convert -i test/fixtures/legacy_format/2024a -f 2024a -o config.yml -t 2025a
```

### Not Working ❌
```bash
# Full conversion from 2016a to YAML (2025a)
suews-convert -i test/fixtures/legacy_format/2016a -f 2016a -o config.yml -t 2025a
```

## Remaining Issue

The conversion from 2016a → 2025a (YAML) fails after the table conversion steps complete successfully. The issue appears to be in the handoff between the table conversion (2016a → 2024a) and the YAML conversion (2024a → 2025a):

1. Table conversion completes successfully
2. Files are properly structured in temp directories
3. When to_yaml module tries to load the converted tables, it encounters:
   - Case sensitivity issues (looking for lowercase filenames)
   - Missing file references (GridLayoutKc.nml created but not found)

## Next Steps

### Priority 1: Fix 2016a → 2025a Full Conversion
1. **Investigate file handoff**: Why do files converted to 2024a format not work with to_yaml?
2. **Case sensitivity**: Fix filename case issues in to_yaml module
3. **Path resolution**: Ensure to_yaml looks in correct directories

### Priority 2: Improve Error Handling
1. Add better error messages when files are missing
2. Validate file existence before conversion steps
3. Add option to continue on non-critical errors

### Priority 3: Code Cleanup
1. Remove debug print statements
2. Fix linting warnings (too many branches/statements)
3. Add comprehensive tests for multi-step conversions

## Files Modified
- `src/supy/util/_converter.py` - Main conversion logic fixes
- `src/supy/cmd/table_converter.py` - Command-line interface
- `src/supy/util/profile_manager.py` - Profile validation (created earlier)
- `src/supy/util/code_manager.py` - Code reference management (created earlier)

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test all version pairs (2016a→2017a, 2017a→2018a, etc.)
2. Test with real-world data files
3. Verify YAML output is valid and complete
4. Check that all referenced codes exist in output

## Notes for Next Session
- The table conversion logic is now solid
- Focus should be on the to_yaml module integration
- Consider whether to_yaml should handle the full conversion internally or rely on pre-conversion to 2024a
