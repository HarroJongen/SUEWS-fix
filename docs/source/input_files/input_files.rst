Input files
===========

.. note::

   Since 2025, SUEWS adopts a new input file format, which is a YAML file, please refer to :ref:`yaml_input` for more details. To accomdate larger compatibility of input files, we sill keep the following sections operational as of May 2025 but will deprecate the table-based input files in the future (end of 2025 estimated; content may still be kept for reference).



SUEWS allows you to input a large number of parameters to describe the characteristics of your site.


YAML-based approach
-------------------

For the new YAML-based input file format, please refer to :ref:`yaml_input`.




Conventional table-based approach (prior to 2025)
--------------------------------------------------

.. warning::

   For new users, please use the YAML-based approach - the conventional table-based approach will be deprecated soon.

the overall control is done via :doc:`RunControl/RunControl`.





Values marked with 'MD' are examples of recommended values (see the suggested references to help decide how appropriate these are for your site/model domain);
values marked with 'MU' need to be set (i.e. changed from the example) for your site/model domain.
