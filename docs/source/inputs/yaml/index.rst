YAML Configuration Format
=========================

The YAML configuration format is the recommended method for providing inputs to SUEWS. It uses a single, structured `config_suews.yml` file to define all model parameters, making simulations easier to manage and reproduce.

Overview
--------

A SUEWS YAML configuration file is organized into two main sections:

1. :ref:`model <model>`: Contains global settings that control the simulation, such as physics options, time stepping, and file paths.
2. :ref:`sites <site>`: A list of one or more sites to be simulated. Each site has its own set of properties, initial conditions, and land cover characteristics.

Here's a minimal example of the YAML structure:

.. code-block:: yaml

   # SUEWS configuration file
   model:
     control:
       tstep: 3600
       forcing_file: "forcing.txt"
     physics:
       net_radiation_method: 3
   
   sites:
     - name: "London_KCL"
       latitude: 51.5115
       longitude: -0.1160
       land_cover:
         paved: 0.38
         bldgs: 0.37
         grass: 0.14

For a complete working example, please refer to the `sample configuration file <https://github.com/UMEP-dev/SUEWS/blob/master/src/supy/sample_run/sample_config.yml>`_ provided with SuPy.


Data Files
----------

In addition to the YAML configuration file, SUEWS works with input and output data files:

**Input Data:**
- **Forcing data**: Meteorological time-series data specified by :ref:`model.control.forcing_file <modelcontrol>`

  The ``forcing_file`` parameter supports two modes:
  
  1. **Single file**: Specify a path to a single forcing file
     
     .. code-block:: yaml
     
        model:
          control:
            forcing_file: "forcing_2020.txt"
     
  2. **Multiple files**: Specify a list of file paths
     
     .. code-block:: yaml
     
        model:
          control:
            forcing_file: 
              - "forcing_2020.txt"
              - "forcing_2021.txt"
              - "forcing_2022.txt"
     
     When multiple files are provided, they will be automatically loaded and concatenated in chronological order.

**Output Data:**
- **Model results**: Time-series output files configured by :ref:`model.control.output_file <modelcontrol>`

  The ``output_file`` parameter now supports advanced configuration:
  
  1. **Output format**: Choose between 'txt' (traditional text files) or 'parquet' (efficient columnar format)
  2. **Output frequency**: Specify custom output frequency in seconds
     - Single value: e.g., ``freq: 3600`` for hourly output
     - Multiple values: e.g., ``freq: [300, 3600]`` for both 5-minute and hourly output
     - Must be multiples of the model timestep
  3. **Output groups**: Select which groups to save (txt format only)
  
  .. note::
     **Backward Compatibility**: When using a simple string value for ``output_file`` (e.g., ``output_file: "output.txt"``), 
     SUEWS will use default settings: txt format, hourly output (3600s), and save only the SUEWS and DailyState groups. 
     This ensures compatibility with existing configuration files.
  
  Example configurations:
  
  .. code-block:: yaml
  
     # Simple backward-compatible configuration (saves only SUEWS and DailyState)
     output_file: "output.txt"
  
     # Parquet output with hourly data
     output_file:
       format: parquet
       freq: 3600
       
     # Text output with selected groups at 30-minute intervals
     output_file:
       format: txt
       freq: 1800
       groups: ["SUEWS", "DailyState", "ESTM"]
  
     # Output at multiple frequencies (5-minute and hourly)
     output_file:
       format: txt
       freq: [300, 3600]
       groups: ["SUEWS", "DailyState"]

- **Input data format and variables**: see :ref:`met_input`
- **Output file formats and variables**: see :ref:`output_files`

Configuration Builder (Experimental)
--------------------------------------

.. note::

   **Interactive Configuration Builder**: An experimental web-based tool for creating YAML configuration files with guided forms.

   üìù **Access the builder**: `SUEWS Configuration Builder <../../_static/index.html>`__

   .. warning::

      **Beta Status**: This configuration builder is currently in development and has not been fully tested. Please verify generated configurations carefully before use.

   Features:

   - Interactive forms for parameter input
   - Basic validation for parameter values
   - YAML file export functionality
   - Integrated parameter documentation

   **Alternative**: You can also create YAML files manually using the schema documentation below or by adapting the sample configuration files provided with SuPy.

Data Model Schema
-----------------

The following pages provide a detailed reference for every component of the YAML data model. Each page corresponds to a specific parameter group and details its available keys, expected data types, units, and default values.

**Key Features of the Schema Documentation:**

- **Clear Method Descriptions**: All model physics methods now include explicit explanations of what each numeric option represents (e.g., 0=MOST, 1=RST, 2=VARIABLE for diagnostic methods)
- **Comprehensive Parameter Documentation**: Every parameter includes its purpose, units, default values, and constraints
- **Hierarchical Organization**: The schema is organized hierarchically, with top-level components (model, site) linking to detailed sub-components
- **Cross-References**: Related parameters and methods are cross-referenced for easier navigation
